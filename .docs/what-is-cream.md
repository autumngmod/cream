# What is cream?
``cream`` is a small library that makes it very easy to create UIs in Garry's Mod using html/css/js (web technologies). This means that you can create UIs in Garry's Mod using ``React/Vue/Svelte/other``, or based on frameworks such as ``NextJS/NextJS``. That is, ``cream`` is an API (interface) with the help of which your web-based project will communicate with Garry's Mod, and require from it certain functionality. This documentation is just trying to tell in detail how and what is organized.

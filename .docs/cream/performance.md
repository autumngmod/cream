# Performance

Obviously, VGUI will be more performant than WebUI, at least because of its small functionality. Yes, you can bend as you want, make up libraries and say that they are very optimized, but the functionality of VGUI will still be low.\

In general, many people may think that if they use WebUI, FPS will immediately drop to 20, but alas it is not so.

According to my subjective observations of FPS drops in a fairly simple UI (just displays HP with animation, and the nickname of the player) FPS drops only 2-3%.

In any case it might be different on other PCs.
Still we don't have [Benchmark tests](./benchmark.md).
